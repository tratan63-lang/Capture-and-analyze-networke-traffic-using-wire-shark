# Capture and Analyze Network Traffic Using Wireshark (Android Alternative)

This project demonstrates network traffic analysis on an Android device using packet capture tools as an alternative to Wireshark.  
It records live network packets, displays statistics such as bytes sent/received, active connections, DNS queries, and memory usage,  
and presents the data in a structured report format.  

## Features
- Capture network packets on Android
- View total bytes sent/received
- Count active connections and DNS queries
- Monitor device memory usage during capture
- Generate clean report format

## Tools Used
- Packet capture app (Android)
- GitHub for documentation and version control

## Sample Report
- **Bytes Sent:** 1.0 MB  
- **Bytes Received:** 2.5 MB  
- **Active Connections:** 111  
- **DNS Queries:** 199  

## Conclusion
This project shows how network traffic can be monitored and analyzed on mobile devices without Wireshark.
